### PageRank and EdmondsKarp Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of the PageRank algorithm and the Edmonds-Karp alogirithm for maximum flow computation. These algorithms were developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate proficiency in graph algorithms and network flow optimization.

#### Algorithms Implemented
- `PageRank.java`: The PageRank algorithm is a fundamental concept in search engine optimization, used extensively by search engines like Google. In the context of our project, the PageRank algorithm is applied to measure the importance or relevance of web pages within a network of interconnected pages. By analyzing the link structure of web pages, PageRank assigns a numerical weighting to each page, indicating its relative importance within the network. This implementation of the PageRank algorithm demonstrates proficiency in analyzing graph structures and determining node rankings based on connectivity and link relationships.
- `EdmondsKarp.java`: The Edmond-Karp algorithm is a classic method for solving the maximum flow problem in network flow optimization. In our project's context, the Edmond-Karp algorithm is utilized to determine the maximum flow of data through a network, which can represent various scenarios such as transportation networks, communication networks, or data processing pipelines. By finding the optimal flow of data from a source node to a destination node while respecting capacity constraints, the Edmond-Karp algorithm aids in optimizing network efficiency and resource allocation. This implementation showcases expertise in network flow algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.
